Hello! Thanks for checking out my research project on Diabetes and Food Access. This project was my final project for BME533 Graduate Biostatistics. In the project, I compared the USDA's Food Access Research atlas data to the CDC's Diabetes Database. The results were interesting and I greatly enjoyed the project.

## Running this Project
If you're interested in replicating the results of this project, you can run the Python files locally. I used Pandas, StatsModels, MatPlotLib, and SciPy for this project. You will have to install these libraries to run the files locally.

Reach out to me at rmanthy [at] hawk [dot] iit [dot] edu with any questions.
